# hello-world
Intro into the world of programming.
Hello world and all who inhabit it! I am excited to be continuing my studies of the computing world, it's something I've played with off and on since middle-school really. I look forward to working on projects and learning from peers. The ultimte aim of this is to see if computer science would be a major that I can excell in and use in life. I hope to find answeres and learn as much as possible.
